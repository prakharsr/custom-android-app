An android application built using Ionic, Angular and Cordova. I used Ionic because it makes hybrid app development (Web + Android + iOS + Desktop) very easy alongwith Angular. Most of the angular code is reusable in Ionic application. Corodova is used for providing native functionality for Wifi, Storage, Flashlight.
I used MVVM architecture for developing this application. In Angular, we have components which is like XAML and has data binding property. Also, in Angular services are injectable to handle events, controllers inject a $scope oject which has two way data binding which makes it possible to bind input and updates to my input are made available to controllers $scope object. This makes MVVM better than others because we don't have to manually update DOM everytime.
